## The Course

This is a 4-week intensive course designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the theoretical foundations, practical applications, and implementation of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). This course will equip students with a solid understanding of key ML concepts, algorithms, and architectures while fostering hands-on skills through interactive labs and project work. By the end of the course, students will have explored topics such as supervised learning, deep learning (including CNNs and transformers), reinforcement learning, and special topics like AI safety and robotics.

Our curriculum draws inspiration from ML courses at MIT and UC Berkeley, complemented by the instructors' academic, research, and professional experiences. Whether you're looking to deepen your knowledge of ML or start your journey in AI, this course will provide the tools and insights needed to succeed. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iiWICADfLh14ev8bhMsBw9Eo3HVfy41S5HNSjZ5a8f0/edit?usp=sharing) is the curriculum for the course.
