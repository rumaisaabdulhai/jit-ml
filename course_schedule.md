## Machine Learning Week 1
All lecture content has been made from scratch for this course. Some content has been taken from MIT's Machine Learning course (6.036, Spring 2022) offered to undergraduate students.

## Python Course Week 2
The lecture material for this course is from the Fall 2016 6.0001 lectures at MIT (on MIT OCW website). This is the first course offered to CS majors, run over a period of 6 weeks. We have chosen a subset of lectures so we can fit the content for this course in one week.

This course is offered to the first year students at JIT. Two lectures are given per day for a total of 4 days.
